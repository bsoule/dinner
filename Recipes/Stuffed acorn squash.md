The basic idea here is to stuff a vegetable with lentils and then cover it in cheese and bury it in a bed of rice that you might spice or flavor with some stuff, and you bake it until the veggies are tender and the cheese is melty and it is very good.

For example, you might stuff an acorn squash, or bell peppers, or you could get weird and stuff zuchinni, or tomatoes or even cabbage leaves, or maybe even eggplant?

## Ingredients
- Vegetable-to-be-stuffed  (if bell peppers, 4 to 6, otherwise use good sense based on size and how many you will be feeding)
- rice -- 1.5 to 2 cups raw, or 3-4 cups cooked (use leftover, or cook it in a rice cooker, or on the stove or whatever)
- lentils -- 1.5 to 2 cups uncooked
- 1 onion
- 1 large can of tomatoes or equivalent
- 1 - 2 c grated cheese

1. dice the onion and tomatoes (save any juices from the tomato)
2. in a pot suitable for cooking the lentils, sautee the onion in some oil 3-5 minutes until translucent
3. reserve half the onion in a dish for later
4. add lentils to the pot with rest of onion
5. add sufficient water (or stock) and generous pinch of salt (omit if using boullion) and cook the lentils
6. core the peppers and oil them lightly and put them in the oven at 350 to roast for about 15-20 minutes while the lentils are cooking, to get them tender. If you are using acorn squash or another hard winter squash you might need to start with this, and pre-cook them a bit longer to get them sufficiently tender.
7. in a deep baking dish mix the onion, tomatoes, rice, and some salt and pepper, and spread out
8. when the lentils are done, and the vegetable-to-be-stuffed is tender, start assembling as so:
9. nestle the stuffing vegetables into the rice and fill with lentils (pack the rice all around them to hold them upright. mix some rice into the lentils before doing this if you want? or if you maybe didn't prepare enough lentils like some of us did the first time they made this)
10. if you have extra juices from the tomatoes, or your lentils were really soupy and you drained them and have some lentil-cooking water handy, pour this over the rice as well
11. top with cheese
12. return to the oven and turn the heat up to 450
13. cook 12-15 minutes until cheese is melty. if you are particularly fond of toasted cheese you can turn the broiler on for a few minutes at the end to get some browning.

Note: we pre-cooked the veggies while the lentils were cooking, with the intention of getting sufficiently cooked veggies without having to cook it all for terribly long at the final stage. This may take some finagling timing-wise to get everything done, or you can plan to cook the final assembled stuffed veggies at a bit lower heat -- 350 say -- for longer than the 12-15 to cook the lentils and vegetables together longer and get the hard squash or whatever more thoroughly cooked. If you wish to do this, I'd recommend adding a cup of extra liquid from the tomatoes or lentils to the rice so it doesn't get dried out and hard on you. Or you could cover the dish with foil for the first 25 mintues or something?

Note 2: if you want to use something like tomatoes, zuchinni, or eggplant which are not hollow of their own accord,  you will have to figure it out yourself... but basically you'd slice the vegatable in half lengthwise, scrape or cut out some of the flesh from the inside, leaving a sort of boat, and then stuff that with the lentil/rice mixture. In this case, it would probably be delicious to use the scraped out innards in the rest of the dish, either mixing in with the rice, or dicing up and adding to the lentil & onion mixture.
